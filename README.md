# ccc25senior
My code in C++ for the 2025 CCC Senior contest I wrote during the contest

Total score - 43/75

Score Distribution:

S1: 15/15

S2: 15/15

S3: 5/15

S4: 8/15

S5: 0/15

- Could have gotten two more points since I solved Subtask 1 of S4 worth 2 points but my Dijkstra solution for 8/15 got TLE on subtask 1, could have combined both codes with a ```if (m == n - 1) subtask 1 code else dijkstra code``` but ran out of time ;(
